# billingSystem

First I will use boolean false for quitting the code. E.g : boolean quitOrNot = false
Second I will use while statement till itâ€™s true the program will run. E.g while (true) <program continues to run>
Then I will use scanner, taking user ID and password in variables for accessing the system. 
After that, I will use Arraylist feature and taking the amount of number of items in variable. The user will input the price of each item s/he wanted to purchase.
Then I will use VAT as a constant for 13% and ask the user whether they want to add VAT or not using if-else statement (the VAT will be used if the user accepts to add VAT).
After that I will use if-else to ask whether the user has discount code or not. If yes, the discount will be added to VAT according to user desire (the discount will not exceed 60%).
After that I will use the output concept to print the total amount that the user has to pay.
Lastly, the user will be asked for payment environment and the system will calculate the change by subtracting the sum of user to the total cost and user if-else condition to change the highest denomination.
